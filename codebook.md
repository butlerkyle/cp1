This codebook describes the variables in the final dataset output from the r script, "finaltable.txt"

Essentially,  it is the mean and standard deviation across multiple movements, summarized by action (e.g. sitting) by subject (e.g. subject #1)

In terms of units, all features are normalized within [-1,1]
