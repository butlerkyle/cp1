Hello! The analysis file "run_analysi.R" does the following: 

Reads in all the individual files
Merges the data sets 
Names the columns in the data sets
Pulls out the requested variable (mean and stdev)
Summarizes the data by Activity by Subject in a new data frame
Writes the summary data frame to a text file

I hope this is detailed enough for you!!!
